Research oriented Petroleum Engineer with a Master of Science in Petroleum Engineering and proficiency in Reservoir Simulation, Production Optimization, Sustainable Strategies, Water Management and Unconventional Resources.

I was also the team leader for the winning cohort at ideanco CLIMATHON 2021, finalist for the Regional Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) Student Paper Contest and secured third for the SPE Abu Dhabi Young Professional Paper Contest (2019). In addition, I also played a significant role in supporting the ADNOC project and assisted in acquiring & planning a project worth $735K in Turkmenistan for enhancing oil recovery through the application of ‘Tailored Smart Brines’ and ‘Self-Adaptive-Polymers’. I was deeply honoured to be recently nominated for the ‘SPE Regional Young Member Outstanding Service Award’ for exceptional contribution to the petroleum industry as a young researcher in the MENA region.\
\
Owing to my passion towards research, I have multiple publications (peer-reviewed and conference proceedings) that reflect my drive for transformation and pursuit to catalyze a change in mind-set. To date, I have co-mentored over 100 students and guided them to successful completion of field management design projects along with assisting graduate students for their thesis investigations.
