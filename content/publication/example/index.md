  Water is one of the most important commodities in the world and plays an
  essential role in the hydrocarbon industry. With increased agricultural
  production, rapid industrialization, population growth and climate change, the
  world is facing an extreme water crisis in many regions. Coupled with a surge
  in energy demand and consumption, this has greatly influenced the hydrocarbon
  industry. With increasing stress on water resources, it is essential to
  examine how water is managed within the hydrocarbon industry and devise ways
  to utilize water more efficiently, especially within water scarce regions such
  as the Middle East.


  Augmented by the recent activities in the oil and gas industry, it can be seen that an economical and efficient hydraulic fracturing job has become crucial for the successful development of unconventional reservoirs. However, exploitation of unconventional reservoirs is heavily water-intensive as compared to conventional reservoirs. In this study, a comprehensive investigation that deals with quantification of changes with respect to the variation in prime contributors within a traditional fracture design process is presented.


  To understand the significance of key design parameters, factors that affect productivity within typical Middle Eastern shale gas reservoirs were analyzed through simple constrained cases. Investigations reveal that parameters such as fracture aperture, natural fracture distribution, fracturing fluid viscosity and Youngâ€™s modulus are crucial to the overall production and water requirement. Furthermore, an outline for resource management within a traditional fracture design process is presented along with potential challenges for the region. Enhancing existing methodologies and incorporating key parameters highlighted within this study can contribute to the overall value chain. In addition to ultimately assisting in the verification of modern best practices, this investigative approach will create a paradigm for future studies for the region to assist in a simplistic prediction of fracture propagation and associated response to augment water usage.

The hydrocarbon industry with its highly advanced technology and significant capital can play a key role in championing the efforts towards efficient water management strategies. This study involved a comprehensive investigation to understand hydraulic fracture propagation behavior in the presence of natural fractures
within Middle Eastern shale gas reservoirs. The factors that affect productivity were analyzed through simple constrained cases to understand the significance of key design parameters. An outline for a water-based fluid management scheme within a traditional fracture design process was also presented along with concerns
within challenging and evolving markets such as the Middle East.
Although there is no single solution to the challenges identified in this study, a workflow tailored to the region may assist in a more efficient and reliable approach. Enhancing existing methodologies and incorporating the key parameters noted above can contribute to the overall value chain.
